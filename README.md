# ADAS_L2

This repo contains simulink libraries and basic algorithms for ADAS features like AEB,ACC,ESA,LCA
This repo is completely created from scratch without any actual algorithms but basic understanding of all these features 
The work is under progress will be updated continuously 

I have tried to explain key concept and basic functioning of these features without actual algorithms like kalman filters,mahalanobis or * algorithms so on

This work is purely to show my eagerness to learn adn upskill myself in MBD domain 
You can find further discussions in model itself.

Thanks
